#Labeling Style Tiles

Please make sure to include the following labels in your style tile:

- A descriptive name (theme, color scheme, etc.)
- All hex codes for colors
- All names of Typefaces/font weights used
- Where typefaces came from (Typekit, Google Fonts etc.)
- *Optional*: What type of project the style tile would work well for (mobile website, portfolio, blog, etc.)

#Saving Style Tiles

Please save all style tiles in the following format:

- An individual .jpg file for your stile tile with a descriptive name
- A folder with any original files (.psd, .ai) - can be zipped up if you want
- File sizes should be 100MB or less (otherwise you won't be able to push them to Github)
